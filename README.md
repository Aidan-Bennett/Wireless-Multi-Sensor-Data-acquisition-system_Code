Building Research Association of New Zealand as part of a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree by Aidan Bennett-Reilly
at Victoria University of Wellington.

____
The source code for four devices in the system are provided, with additional code for use when debugging the XBee radios on the sensor units through USB. The Base station unit includes the same debugging functionality within its main code.

____
Two Micro-Controllers are used in this project, the Atmel ATMega 32u4 and the Atmel SAMD21J18A ARM Cortex-M0+ based MCU, which use customised bootloaders and work with the Arduino IDE, provided the IDE is setup with the board variant files.
